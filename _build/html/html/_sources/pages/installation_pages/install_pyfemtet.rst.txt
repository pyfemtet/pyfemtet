Install PyFemtet
================

This step requires administrator privileges.

.. note::
    
    This procedure requires Python 3.11 or 3.12. If you are installing
    PyFemtet on a different version of Python, follow the manual
    instructions at the end of this page.


Please download and run the script below. 

:download:`pyfemtet-installer.ps1 <../../pyfemtet-installer.ps1>` 

To run the .ps1 file, right click and select "run with powershell".


.. warning::

    This script assumes that your Python installation includes `py launcher`.
    If you have done a custom installation of Python, **make sure that
    your installation configuration includes the py launcher.**


.. tip::

    If you want to configure pyfemtet in a virtual environment (or anyway without `py launcher`),
    **change line 24 of the script** to the following, activate the
    virtual environment, and run the script from the command line: ::

        $python_command = "python"


If this step fails, try the following steps manually:

    setup_femtet_macro
