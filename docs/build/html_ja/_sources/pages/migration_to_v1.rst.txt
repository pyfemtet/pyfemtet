migration_to_v1
===============

**To Users of PyFemtet 0.x**

In PyFemtet v1, many functions and arguments have been changed
to improve user-friendliness and development efficiency.

Versions 0.9 and later serve as transition versions to v1,
where legacy functions and arguments are still fully available;
however, features that have been changed or removed will issue warnings.

The main changes in version 1 are listed on this page along with usage examples.
If you need to modify your existing scripts, please refer to the examples below.
