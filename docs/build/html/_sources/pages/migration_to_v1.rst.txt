migration_to_v1
===============

.. note::

   This page is the migration guide for
   **your code written in pyfemtet 0.x to adapt 1.x**.
   
   Please run the following command
   to detect your ``pyfemtet`` version: ::

      py -m pip show pyfemtet

   If you use virtual environment and so on, the command is: ::

      python -m pip show pyfemtet

   If the version is already 1.x and
   your code is written in 1.x,
   you do not have to read this page.

   Even if the version is 0.x,
   in case that you will not update ``pyfemtet``,
   you have not to read this page.


.. note::

   If you want to update ``pyfemtet``, see
   :doc:`installation_pages/install_pyfemtet`
   or
   :doc:`installation_pages/install_pyfemtet_manually`


In PyFemtet v1, many functions and arguments have been changed
to improve usability and development efficiency.

Versions 0.9 serves as transition versions to v1,
where legacy functions and arguments are still fully available;
however, features that have been changed or removed will issue warnings.

The main changes in version 1 are listed on this page along with usage examples.
If you need to modify your existing scripts, please refer to the examples below.

   :depth: 3


How to import exceptions like ModelError
----------------------------------------

They will be moved to ``pyfemtet.opt.exceptions`` module.

.. code-block:: python

   # < 1.0.0
   from pyfemtet.core import ModelError, MeshError, SolveError

   # >= 1.0.0
   from pyfemtet.opt.exceptions import ModelError, MeshError, SolveError


add_objective() and add_constraints()
-------------------------------------

``name`` argument
+++++++++++++++++

The ``name`` argument will be the first argument and required.

.. code-block:: python

   def some_objective(Femtet):
      ...

   # < 1.0.0
   femopt.add_objective(some_objective, 'objective name')

   # >= 1.0.0
   femopt.add_objective('objective name', some_objective)

   # The samples below works with both versions
   femopt.add_objective(name='objective name', fun=some_objective)
   femopt.add_objective(fun=some_objective, name='objective name')


``args`` argument
+++++++++++++++++

The ``args`` will be recognized as a sequence.

.. code-block:: python

   # < 1.0.0
   femopt.add_objective(..., args=femopt.opt)

   # The samples below works with both versions
   femopt.add_objective(..., args=(femopt.opt,))
   # or
   femopt.add_objective(..., args=[femopt.opt])


Arguments of User-Defined Functions in cases other than FemtetInterface
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In cases other than ``FemtetInterface`` (for example,
``ExcelInterface``), the first argument of user-defined
functions is given by PyFemtet.

This item is not relevant when using the FemtetInterface
and its derived classes (such as FemtetWithNXInterface).


.. code-block:: python

   # < 1.0.0
   def user_defined(opt):
       ...

   # >= 1.0.0
   def user_defined(fem, opt):
       ...

   # The samples below works with both versions
   femopt.add_objective(fun=user_defined, args=(opt,))


.. note::

   What is passed to the first argument varies depending
   on the FEMInterface you using. For example, ``ExcelInterface`` passes COM object of Excel(R)
   to your function. 
   
   For details, please refer to
   the `API Reference of Latest version <https://pyfemtet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/api.html>`__ of each class.
   If the concrete classâ€™s API reference does not include
   an object_pass_to_fun section, please refer to the
   corresponding section in its parent class.


``opt.variables.get_variables()`` method
----------------------------------------

The ``opt.variables.get_variables()`` will be deprecated.
Use ``opt.get_variables()`` instead.

.. code-block:: python

   # < 1.0.0
   def constraint(_, opt: AbstractOptimizer):
      d = opt.variables.get_variables()  # d is dict[str, float]
      ...

   # >= 1.0.0
   def constraint(_, opt: AbstractOptimizer):
      d: dict[str, float]  = opt.get_variables()  # d is dict[str, float]
      ...


``history_path`` argument
-------------------------

The ``history_path`` argument is now in ``femopt.oprimize``.

.. code-block:: python

   # < 1.0.0
   femopt = FEMOpt(
      history_path'sample.csv',
   )
   ...
   femopt.optimize()

   # >= 1.0.0
   femopt = FEMOpt()
   ...
   femopt.optimize(
      history_path='sample.csv'
   )
